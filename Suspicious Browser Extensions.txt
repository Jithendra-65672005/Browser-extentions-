1. Open your browser’s extension/add-ons manager
Chrome/Edge: Go to Menu (⋮) → More tools → Extensions or type chrome://extensions/ in the address bar.
Firefox: Go to Menu (☰) → Add-ons and themes → Extensions.

2. Review all installed extensions carefully
Look at the name, publisher, and installation date.
Check if you remember installing each one.

3. Check permissions and reviews for each extension
Click Details to see permissions (e.g., “Read your browsing history” or “Access all websites”).
Search the extension name online + “reviews” or “scam” to see other users’ feedback.

4. Identify any unused or suspicious extensions
Unused = installed but you don’t actively use them.
Suspicious = unknown developer, bad reviews, or unnecessary high-risk permissions.

5. Remove suspicious or unnecessary extensions
Click Remove or Trash icon next to the extension name.

6. Restart your browser and check for performance improvements
Closing and reopening will fully unload removed extensions.
Check if pages load faster or the browser feels smoother.

7. Research how malicious extensions can harm users
Examples:
Data theft: Stealing passwords, credit card numbers, or browsing history
Tracking: Logging every site you visit.
Ad injection: Showing extra ads or pop-ups.
Browser hijacking: Redirecting searches to unsafe sites.

8. Document steps taken and extensions removed
Keep a simple log like: 
Date: 14 Aug 2025
Extensions removed: "PDF Converter Pro" (unused), "FastSearch" (suspicious – bad reviews)
Browser: Google Chrome
Reason: Performance improvement and security
